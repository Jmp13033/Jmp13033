Hello, my name is Jared Peck and I am an ABA therapist turned Machine Learning Engineer,  A year and a half ago, I had an idea to build a full stack gym application which could help users plan their gym workouts. In order to do so, I had gone to a Full Stack Applications program called Coding Dojo.  There, I had learned Python, Java, and Javascript. After developing and dabbling in the area of full stack applications, I had decided to start to dive into the field of Data Analysis and Machine Learning. After building my first model using sklearn, pandas, visual libraries... I was hooked. My passion for data engineering, data cleaning,  Exploratory Data Analysis and building solid Machine Learning models grew exponentially.  After Learning how to code these I really wanted to know how the Math behind the models worked.  So, I began reading multiple books on each of the topics, diving deep into the math designing full models and Data Explorations for each algorithm. This ongoing repository highlights my passion for Data Science and desire to keep learning.
